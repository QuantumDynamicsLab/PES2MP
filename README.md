# PES2MP
The program can generates Pis4 based Potential energy surface internally (with capabilities to generate input files for Gaussian, Molpro and Psi4 for external calculations) for atom - atom (1D), rigid rotor(RR) - atom (2D) and RR - RR (4D) collision. A tensorflow (keras) based neural networks model can be created to augment the surface with high degree of accuracy (at both minima and high energy region) OR (if angular augmentation is not necessary) radial terms for each angle(s) can be analytically fitted to get missing R values. Finally the PES is fitted into Legendre (2D) and Bispherical Harmonics (4D) to get radial terms which can be used to study rotational transitions induced by the collider.
